# Question 1 
** Git is an example of a version control system **

# Question 2
** A code hosting service that uses Git is GitHub **

# Question 3
** The 3 stages in GIT that files can be in are: **

1. ** Modified:** The file has still not been committed to the databse. This is the initial stage. The file exists but it is not being tracked 
2. ** Staged:** A file becomes staged when we use git add. The file is prepared to be committed 
3. ** Committed:** A committed file is permanently stored in the Git directory 

# Question 4
** PR means Pull Request. This is how we propose changes we have pushed to a branch in a repository. When we submitt a pull request to the main repository, others can review or code and provide feedback
repo means repository. A repository stores all the files and all the history of changes we have made to a project. It is a centralised location that allow us to collaborate with others and to perform veriosn control **

# Question 5
** The git command that updates the local repository with changes from the
remote repository is git pull **

# Question 6
** The git command that gets the changes from the remote repository but
doesnâ€™t update the local repository is git fetch **

# Question 7
** The git command that updates the remote repository with local repository
code is git push ** 

# Question 8
** For the git commit command to work we need the files we want to committ to be staged. This is done via the 'git add' command.**
